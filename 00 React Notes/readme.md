# React Introduction
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is the view layer for web application.

At the heart of all React appliactions are components. A component is a self contained module that renders some output. For example, take a form. A form might consist of many interface elements, like input fileds, labels, or buttons. Each element inside the form can be written as a React component. We'd then write higher-level component, the form component itself.
